These are some personal java projects based on games that were used with learning purposes.
In this case, they don't have any copyrights so, feel free do use it as needed.
Some of them may be incomplete due to lack of time, hardware and software problems but the intention is to come back to it and finish it to have at least one game published for IOS and Android.

As concepts for Java, this were the first steps, passing by programming logic, variables(local and global), scanner, list, arrays, events, exceptions, switch, loopings and so on.
It's also focused on some files that are considered driver files, since we require a primary file to run it. It also contain extensors, comprehensors, advance functions, getters and setters and a few
other concepts that I would like you to know and try.

Please let me know if you have any questions and, if you want to be a colaborator, please getting in touch with me.
